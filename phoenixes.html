		<p> Phoenixes are mythical birds sometimes known as &ldquo;Fire Birds&rdquo;, as some myths state that they burst into fire 
			before dying and regenerating. They are also depicted as having red or orange feathers, making them look somewhat like 
			a streak of fire when they fly across the sky. They are said to have a lifespan of more than 500 years, and according 
			to some recent media, phoenixes do not look the best when they are very old or very young, but at the prime of their lives, 
			they are gorgeous.

			The phoenix is oftentimes associated with Greek and Egyptian Mythology, as the earliest mentions of the phoenix are 
			believed to have stemmed from Ancient Greece and Ancient Egypt. In Greek Mythology, the phoenix is said to be immortal, 
			as it regenerates every time it dies. In Egyptian mythology, it is said that there is only ever one phoenix at a time; 
			at the end of the phoenix&rsquo;s more than 500 year lifespan, it would set itself on fire, and a new phoenix would 
			arise from the ashes.

			One of the most popular appearances of a phoenix is in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter">&ldquo;Harry Potter&rdquo;</a> 
			series by J. K. Rowling, where the character Albus Dumbledore has a phoenix names Fawkes. In this series, the phoenix 
			is shown to turn to ash before ressurecting and becoming a young bird again. This phoenix is also shown to have magical 
			properties, as its tears can heal wounds, and at unbelievable speeds. Like most phoenixes, Fawkes bursts into flames before
			being reborn from its ashes. According to this series, phoenixes don&rsquo;t look very majestic just before or after their death,
			but in the primes of their lives, they are very majestic, with beautiful red and orange feathers.
