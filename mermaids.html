		<h2 id="Appearance"> Appearance </h2>
		<p> Mermaids are usually portrayed as creatures with the head and torso of a woman (or person in general, but women are more 
			commonly portrayed in the media), and the tail of a fish. They are depicted as beautiful creatures, but they can be good
			or bad, resembling humans in this sense. Some can fall in love with humans, and at times they can bestow good things upon 
			people, but when they are upset, they can bring forth harm, such as in the form of shipwrecks. Due to this, seeing a 
			mermaid while at sea was seen as bad luck in the past.

		<h4 id="The-Original-Version"> The Original Version </h4>
		<p> The book &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid">The Little Mermaid&rdquo;</a> by Hans 
			Christian Anderson was published in 1837. The story is a romance and a tragedy, but one with a happy ending, and it is 
			about a mermaid who longs to be part of the human world, and falls in love with a prince who she saves from a shipwreck. 
			However, the prince never knows this, and he falls in love with someone else, who he thought was his saviour. The 
			Little Mermaid longs even more to be human after meeting the prince, so she goes to the Sea Witch, who gives her a 
			potion to give her legs in exchange for her beautiful voice. Once on the shore, the Little Mermaid is found by the 
			prince, and he takes her in, though does not fall in love with her like she had originally wanted. Instead, he wishes 
			to marry the other woman, who he thought was the one who saved his life. On the day of their wedding, the Little 
			Mermaid&rsquo;s sisters come to her and give her a dagger. They tell her that in exchange for their hair, they made a 
			deal with the Sea Witch that if the Little Mermaid killed the prince, she would become a mermaid again. However, the 
			Little Mermaid cannot bring herself to kill the prince, and instead throws herself and the dagger into the sea. Although 
			she expected to dissolve into foam, like all mermaids do when they die, she becomes a &ldquo;Daughter of the 
			Air&rdquo;, or a spirit, because of her selflessness.

		<h4 id="Disney-Adaptation"> Disney&rsquo;s Adaptation</h4>
		<p> 
			In 1989, Disney published an animated movie named &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(1989_film)">The 
			Little Mermaid&rdquo;</a> that was based off of Hans Christian Anderson&rsquo;s novel. The movie follows Ariel, a 
			sixteen year old mermaid who longs to be human and immerse herself in the human world. The general plot is very similar 
			to that of the original novel&rsquo;s, however some aspects of it have been changed to make it (arguably) more 
			appealing and child-friendly. The biggest differences are the ending and the other woman who the prince marries, as the 
			in the Disney version, the Sea Witch disguises herself as a beautiful woman to sabotage Ariel and take the prince away 
			from her, but in the end, Ariel stays human and marries the prince.

		<p> 
			The official reason for the differences between the book and the movie of this story is unknown, but certain factors may
			have played a part in the changes. For example, many of Disney&rsquo;s animated movies are for the entire family, so they
			may have deemed the scene in the book where the Little Mermaid&rsquo;s sisters tell her to kill the prince to be a bit too
			dark for some members of their audience. Additionally, there are certain tropes in Disney movies, such as the protagonist
			finding love in and getting married to the prince (or any character), so the fact that the Little Mermaid doesn&rsquo;t 
			do this, and the prince ends up marrying someone else, might have been too different for Disney. In the book, there were 
			also a few allusions to religion, so to appeal to a greater audience, Disney may have chosen to stay away from this theme.

		<h3 id="Sirens">Sirens</h3>
		<p> Sirens are often used interchangeably with mermaids, however they were not thought to be the same being in the early 
			days of their existence. Sirens used to be depicted as half-bird and half-human, but by the middle ages, this description 
			had changed so that sirens were half-fish and half-human. In other words, their appearance became that of mermaids. Like
			mermaids, sirens are depicted as being very beautiful, however in the myths surrounding them, mainly in Greek Mythology,
			it was said that they would lure sailors to the rocks with their enchanting voices, causing the boats to crash. The most 
			famous example of a work of literature with this occurrence is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey">&ldquo;The 
			Odyssey&rdquo;</a> by Homer.
