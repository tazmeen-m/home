		<h1> Vampires </h1>
		<h2> Overview </h2>
		<h2>Characteristics</h2>
		<p>
			Some of the stereotypical characteristics of vampires as we know them today are that they suck blood, they can&rsquo;t see
			themselves in mirrors, they can be warded off with garlic, and they burn in the sun. But most of these traits are just the depictions that people
			in the past had for phenomenons that they could not explain at the time, but can now be explained with science.
		</p>
		<h2> Why Were Vampires Believed to be the &ldquo;Undead&rdquo;? </h2>
		<p> 
			The version of the vampire that we know today largely stemmed from eighteenth century Europe, where many beliefs were 
			held regarding the relation vampires had with the dead. Many of these beliefs stemmed from an incomplete understanding 
			of what happens to a corpse after death. When a dead body is left for a certain amount of time, its skin starts to shrink,
			and in turn the hair and nails appear to have grown. This was likely the reason why people thought that the corpse was 
			still &ldquo;alive&rdquo;, in a way. This, combined with the fact that the breaking down of internal organs 
			can lead to a dark liquid leaking out of the nose and the mouth of the corpse, may have made people think that these 
			corpses were the &ldquo;undead&rdquo;, or people coming back to life to feed on the blood of other creatures, when in truth
			this was not blood at all.
		</p>
		<h2>Portrayal in Media</h2>
		<p>
			One of the most popular depictions of vampires is in the &ldquo;Twilight&rdquo; series by Stephanie Meyer. In this adaptation,
			vampires are portrayed as having largely the same characteristics as the general vampire, with the only big difference being that
			they shone in the sun rather than burning. This shows just how big of a mark vampires have had on media, as despite all the science
			proving that vampires are not real, people find it enjoyable to imagine a world where they are real.
