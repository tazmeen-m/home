		<h2 id="Appearance">Appearance</h2>
		<p>There are quite a few common attributes in the appearance of the version of the vampire that has made it into today&rsquo;s 
			world. For example, vampires are usually seen wearing dark colours, such as black, and they oftentimes have capes as well. 
			Additionally, they are known to have sharp fangs, which aid them in the act of drinking blood that has become attributed to 
			vampires throughout the ages. 
		</p>
		<h2 id="Characteristics">Characteristics</h2>
		<p>
			Some of the stereotypical characteristics of vampires as we know them today are that they suck blood, they can&rsquo;t see
			themselves in mirrors, they can be warded off with garlic, and they burn in the sun. There are some characteristics that are 
			unique to certain media forms, such as them having super speed, but most of the stereotypical traits are just the depictions 
			that people in the past had for phenomenons that they could not explain at the time, but can now be explained with science.
		</p>
		<h2> Why Were Vampires Believed to be the &ldquo;Undead&rdquo;? </h2>
		<p> 
			The version of the vampire that we know today largely stemmed from eighteenth century Europe, where many beliefs were 
			held regarding the relation vampires had with the dead. Many of these beliefs stemmed from an incomplete understanding 
			of what happens to a corpse after death. When a dead body is left for a certain amount of time, its skin starts to shrink,
			and in turn the hair and nails appear to have grown. This was likely the reason why people thought that the corpse was 
			still &ldquo;alive&rdquo;, in a way. This, combined with the fact that the breaking down of internal organs 
			can lead to a dark liquid leaking out of the nose and the mouth of the corpse, may have made people think that these 
			corpses were the &ldquo;undead&rdquo;, or people coming back to life to feed on the blood of other creatures, when in truth
			this was not blood at all.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Portrayal-in-Media">Portrayal in Media</h2>
		<p>
			One of the most popular depictions of vampires is in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_(Meyer_novel)">&ldquo;Twilight&rdquo;</a> 
			series by Stephanie Meyer. In this adaptation, vampires are portrayed as having largely the same characteristics as the 
			general vampire, with the only big difference being that they shone in the sun rather than burning, and that they have 
			certain superpowers, like super speed. This shows just how big of a mark vampires have had on media, as despite all the 
			science proving that vampires are not real, people find it enjoyable to imagine a world where they are real. A second 
			popular depiction of vampires is in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Transylvania">&ldquo;Hotel Transylvania&rdquo;</a>
			series. This franchise depicts vampires as similar to humans, and the main character, a &ldquo;teenage&rdquo; vampire, goes 
			through largely the same problems most teenagers go through in the human world. This makes the characters relatable, as
			well as helps people lose their fear of vampires, which works as a strong combatant to the fear that people used to have of 
			vampires in the past, when they were seen as a real threat.
