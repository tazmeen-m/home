		<p> 
			Unicorns are often portrayed in media as a creature with the body of a horse, but with a pointed, spiralling horn on 
			its forehead. They&rsquo;re described as having a white coat, and either a white mane or a rainbow coloured one. They are 
			also oftentimes depicted as being connected to rainbows, and both unicorns and rainbows have been linked to peace and 
			happiness.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Origins"> Origins </h2>
		<p>Unicorns have appeared in several parts of the world even in the early days of their existence, including in Mesopotamia,
			India, China, and Greece. Because of this, it&rsquo;s difficult to pinpoint the exact location where unicorns first originated,
			so it&rsquo;s safe to say that the unicorn we know and love today is a mixture of many different cultures.

		<h2 id="Powers"> Powers </h2>
		<p>The blood of the unicorn is arguably the one of the most powerful aspects of a unicorn, according to some works of 
			literature. For example, In the book/movie series &ldquo;Harry Potter&rdquo;, unicorn blood is said to &ldquo;keep you
			alive, even if you are an inch from death&rdquo;. This shows just how powerful the unicorn must be, if just its blood 
			can hold such properties.

		<h2 id="Portrayal-in-Media"> Portrayal in Media </h2>
		<p> Unicorns are very popular amongst children, as they are seen as beautiful, majestic, and innocent animals. Many children&rsquo;s 
			birthday parties, for example, have been centered around a unicorn theme, and certain characters have only added to this 
			trend. For example, Agnes from &ldquo;Despicable Me&rdquo; was obsessed with unicorns, and because of this, people constantly
			saw unicorns in a good light, only making people like them more.

			Pegasus is a mythical creature that, like the unicorn, is mainly resemblent of a horse. However, unlike the unicorn,
			it has no horn on its forehead, but rather two large wings on either side of its body. Pegasus is a prominent character 
			in Greek Mythology, as his father is said to be the God of the Sea, Poseidon. There is a constellation in the sky that is
			named after Pegasus, and in Greek Mythology it&rsquo;s believed that this constellation was Zeus&rsquo;s way of honouring
			Pegasus.
