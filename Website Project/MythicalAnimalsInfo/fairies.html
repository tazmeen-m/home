		<h1 id="Top"> Fairies </h1>
		<p> There is conflicting information on what creatures are classified as, as fairies can represent either a group of mythical
			creature or just a single one, so for the sake of simplicity, the fairy will be treated as its own entity here rather than 
			a group of beings. Fairies are small beings, which hold magical powers.

			Fairies are usually described as being very small, and oftentimes they have wings on their backs. Because of how small they
			are, they are oftentimes seen as delicate beings, but in truth they are also quite powerful due to the magic they possess.

		<p>One of the most famous fairies in media is Tinker Bell. Originally from the 1904 play &ldquo;Peter Pan&rdquo; by J. M. Barrie,
			and the corresponding novel, and further popularized by the 1953 film of &ldquo;Peter Pan&rdquo; by Walt Disney, this small 
			blonde-haired, green-outfitted character has captured the hearts of many people growing up through many generations.
